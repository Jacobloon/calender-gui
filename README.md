# calender-gui
CSCI 150 Project to create functioning calendar with working GUI. 
Final Proposal 

TODO: 
Finish code for date actions Ex. Delete Events, Add Events, ect. 
Interactive Tkinter dates Ex. Click on a date to prompt actions
Align Tkinter dates with (Monday - Sunday) format Ex. December 1st on Wednesday

Calendar With Interactive GUI:
This project will create a combined calendar and planner that focuses on specific months. Data entered into the planned will be stored in parallel .csv files. Multiple user profile calendars can be entered and referenced.
Comments: “Start at one month, if there is a conflict show that, could have multiple referenced calendars.”
